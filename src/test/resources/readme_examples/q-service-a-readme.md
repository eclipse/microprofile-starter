# MicroProfile generated Application

## Introduction

MicroProfile Starter has generated this MicroProfile application for you.

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command

    mvn clean compile quarkus:build

This will create a jar file **quarkus-runner.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

    java -jar target/quarkus-runner.jar

You can also start the project in development mode where it automatically updates code on the fly as you save your files:

    mvn clean compile quarkus:dev

Last but not least, you can build the whole application into a one statically linked executable that does not require JVM:

    mvn clean compile quarkus:native-image -Pnative

Native executable build might take a minute. Then you can execute it on a compatible architecture without JVM:

    ./target/quarkus-runner

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

    http://localhost:8080/index.html

## Note on Native image

 * You need GraalVM installed from the GraalVM web site. Using the community edition is enough. Version 19.1.1+ is required.
 * The GRAALVM_HOME environment variable configured appropriately
 * The native-image tool must be installed; this can be done by running ```gu install native-image``` from your GraalVM directory
 * To read more about Quarkus and Native image, see https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide

## Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)


### Config

Configuration of your application parameters. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config)

The example class **ConfigTestController** shows you how to inject a configuration parameter and how you can retrieve it programmatically.



### Fault tolerance

Add resilient features to your applications like TimeOut, RetryPolicy, Fallback, bulkhead and circuit breaker. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-fault-tolerance)

The example class **ResilienceController** has an example of a FallBack mechanism where an fallback result is returned when the execution takes too long.



### Health

The health status can be used to determine if the 'computing node' needs to be discarded/restarted or not. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-health)

The class **ServiceHealthCheck** contains an example of a custom check which can be integrated to health status checks of the instance.  The index page contains a link to the status data.



### Metrics

The Metrics exports _Telemetric_ data in a uniform way of system and custom resources. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-metrics)

The example class **MetricController** contains an example how you can measure the execution time of a request.  The index page also contains a link to the metric page (with all metric info)



### JWT Auth

Using the OpenId Connect JWT token to pass authentication and authorization information to the JAX-RS endpoint. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-jwt-auth)

Have a look at the **TestSecureController** class which calls the protected endpoint on the secondary application.
The **ProtectedController** (secondary application) contains the protected endpoint since it contains the _@RolesAllowed_ annotation on the JAX-RS endpoint method.

The _TestSecureController_ code creates a JWT based on the private key found within the resource directory.
However, any method to send a REST request with an appropriate header will work of course. Please feel free to change this code to your needs.



### Open API

Exposes the information about your endpoints in the format of the OpenAPI v3 specification. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-open-api)

The index page contains a link to the OpenAPI information of your endpoints.




### Open Tracing

Allow the participation in distributed tracing of your requests through various micro services. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-opentracing)

To show this capability download [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io/download/#binaries) and run ```./jaeger-all-in-one```.
Open [http://localhost:16686/](http://localhost:16686/) to see the traces. Mind that you have to access your demo app endpoint for any traces to show on Jaeger UI.




### Rest Client

A type safe invocation of HTTP rest endpoints. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-rest-client)

The example calls one endpoint from another JAX-RS resource where generated Rest Client is injected as CDI bean.
