# MicroProfile generated Applications

MicroProfile Starter has generated 2 MicroProfile applications for you.

There are 2 projects generated so that the examples for the Rest Client and/or JWT Auth specification are more realistic in the sense that they actually call an endpoint within another service.

. In the `service-a` directory, you can find an application with the major parts of the application. This can be seen as the 'client'.
. In the `service-b` directory, you can find some endpoints which will be called by code within the client application. This can be seen as the 'backend'.

Have a look in the `readme.md` file in each directory which describes how each project can be built and run.
